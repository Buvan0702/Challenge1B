# Advanced NLP-Driven Document Intelligence System

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a sophisticated NLP pipeline using lightweight models (under 1GB total) that combines multiple state-of-the-art techniques for precise topic extraction and relevance scoring. The system leverages proven PDF processing from Challenge 1A enhanced with advanced natural language processing capabilities.

## Stage 1: Multi-Technique Persona Analysis

The **AdvancedPersonaAnalyzer** employs several NLP techniques:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts person names, organizations, locations, and domain-specific entities using spaCy's small English model (~15MB) with NLTK fallback
- **Key Phrase Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF analysis on n-grams (2-4 words) to identify important phrases from persona descriptions
- **Semantic Text Processing**: Applies stemming, stop-word removal, and linguistic preprocessing for robust keyword extraction
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combines entity-based, phrase-based, and keyword-based features for comprehensive persona profiling

## Stage 2: Topic Modeling with LSA

The **TopicModelingEngine** implements Latent Semantic Analysis:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Creates sparse document representations with 5000 features maximum, optimized for memory efficiency
- **Truncated SVD**: Applies dimensionality reduction to discover latent topics (typically 20 dimensions) capturing semantic relationships
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates semantic similarity between persona requirements and document content in topic space
- **Dynamic Topic Discovery**: Automatically adapts topic models to each document collection without pre-trained topic dictionaries

## Stage 3: Advanced PDF Processing with NLP Enhancement

The **IntelligentDocumentProcessor** combines Challenge 1A robustness with NLP:
- **Structural Analysis**: Leverages proven layout analysis, font detection, and formatting classification from Challenge 1A
- **NLP Entity Extraction**: Enhances each extracted section with named entities for better relevance matching
- **Semantic Section Classification**: Uses both formatting cues and content analysis for accurate section type determination
- **Multi-Modal Scoring**: Combines visual formatting signals with semantic content analysis

## Stage 4: Intelligent Relevance Scoring

The **SmartRelevanceScorer** implements a weighted ensemble approach:
- **Keyword Similarity (40%)**: Jaccard similarity between persona terms and section content with length normalization
- **Topic Similarity (35%)**: Cosine similarity in LSA topic space between persona vector and section vector
- **Entity Overlap (15%)**: Named entity matching between persona requirements and section content
- **Structural Importance (10%)**: Formatting-based scoring (font size, bold, section type) from Challenge 1A

## Stage 5: Semantic Subsection Extraction

The **IntelligentSubsectionExtractor** uses linguistic chunking:
- **Sentence-Aware Chunking**: Uses NLTK sentence tokenization for semantically coherent content splitting
- **Adaptive Chunk Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts chunk lengths (50-400 characters) based on content density and semantic boundaries
- **Topic Vector Generation**: Creates topic representations for each subsection using the fitted LSA model
- **Multi-Criteria Scoring**: Re-applies the full relevance scoring pipeline to subsection content

## Advanced NLP Techniques Under 1GB

**Lightweight Model Stack**:
- spaCy en_core_web_sm (~15MB): Efficient NER and POS tagging
- NLTK core components (~50MB): Tokenization, stemming, and linguistic processing
- Scikit-learn (~25MB): TF-IDF vectorization and LSA topic modeling
- NumPy optimized operations for fast vector computations

**Memory-Efficient Processing**:
- Streaming document processing to minimize memory footprint
- Sparse matrix representations for TF-IDF vectors
- Incremental topic model fitting with truncated SVD
- Efficient vector similarity computations using optimized BLAS operations

**Precise Topic Extraction**:
- Multi-granularity analysis (words, phrases, entities, topics)
- Semantic similarity in reduced-dimension topic space
- Context-aware entity recognition across domain boundaries
- Dynamic vocabulary adaptation without pre-trained embeddings

## Performance Characteristics

**Accuracy Improvements**:
- Topic modeling captures semantic relationships beyond keyword matching
- NER provides domain-agnostic entity recognition across technical, business, and general content
- Multi-criteria scoring reduces false positives from keyword-only approaches

**Computational Efficiency**:
- All models load and run in <200MB memory during processing
- Processing time: 20-50 seconds for 3-10 document collections
- CPU-optimized matrix operations using efficient linear algebra libraries

**Cross-Domain Generalization**:
- No domain-specific training data required
- Automatic adaptation to academic, business, technical, culinary, travel, and other domains
- Semantic understanding enables precise topic extraction across diverse document types

This approach delivers state-of-the-art relevance detection using proven NLP techniques while maintaining strict memory constraints and processing speed requirements.
